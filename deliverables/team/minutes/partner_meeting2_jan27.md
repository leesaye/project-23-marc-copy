## Notes

- Marc’s Suggestions
    
    - Relationship rating- Have a form with questions & use an AI to rank the relationship based on the answers. Circle back in 24 hours with possible questions.
    - automatic filling out for new contact based on what info we can out, give opportunity for user to change/fill out the rest.
        - Custom fields when adding a contact (ex. anniversary)
        - otherwise, have a csv spreadsheet
    - Social media platform- not needed right now
    - reminder automation would work for milestones, wants to try it via AI
    - LinkedIn integration: example taplio
    - feed page: could have activity, other insights
    - Task management/ relationship management page
    - Will provide data schemas, including field names
    - Integrate activity reminders. For example: If Marc’s birthday is coming up, give a reminder + provide suggestions on what to do. Send an email with “Happy Birthday!”
        - Easier to do through email
    
    **Notes from Q&A section:**
    
    What is the difference between AI Insights and Rate Friendship (would you want a relationship rating alg., would you want an AI insights page/My Activity page, etc.)
    
    - Questionnaire for Relationship Rating, based on that AI Algorithm can create a rating
    
    Have you considered personal CRM as social media, so you can just aggregate all the social media
    
    - This is part of the other project that the other team is working on. Don’t do this, he wants this for V2.
    
    Did you envision users manually entering contacts? Or was there some other method?
    
    - If we have existing profile linkedin then we can pull info from their account. Or input info into a csv and upload that to the CRM.
    
    How to automate adding reminders?
    
    - Once we know a milestone to set an reminder for, use AI to remind the user to log in and send a message.
    
    Improvements:
    
    Feed:
    
    - Add things that are upcoming (this could be in the feed or as separate task sections)
    
    Contacts Page:
    
    - Add custom fields for each person (eg. Anniversary)
    
    Think about how we action data?
    
    - Use AI to generate a message that says Happy Birthday?
