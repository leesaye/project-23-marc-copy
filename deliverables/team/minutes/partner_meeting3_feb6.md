## Notes

- Under contacts, he would like contacts associated with their phone/email in addition to LinkedIn, specific focus on Gmail and Outlook
- Our focus for this deliverable is the manual version of the contacts page along with csv if we are able to, as well as a manual focus for the calendar (Mark approves)
- Automatic and manual reminders in the calendar. The user can manually log their interactions (i.e met up with a contact for a zoom meeting or a coffee). The user will also have automated tasks (i.e wish someone a Happy Birthday) in the calendar
- Contacts page should have the ability to click into a contact and view all logged interactions in the database associated with the contact
- Asked if we can see an interaction page for each contact (maybe through the contacts page) - like a networks page
- went through the figma w/ Marc
    - Likes the motivational quote on the homepage and the reminders
    - Contacts Page: questionnaire in addition to the rating and social
        - he just wants to ensure that those questions can be changed down the road, as well as the weight of each question
        - he thinks for now we should focus on having a questionnaire for all contacts, understands that it is not feasible, so it is something that we can think about in the future
        - Adding contacts manually - prompt the user to check the connection score via a questionnaire
        - Implement a placeholder questionnaire for D2 when creating a new contact - ask things like what do you think your strength is? easy questions
    - Weekly calendar system, with pink posts would be reminders/to-do items and brown would upcoming meetings/events
    - Likes the idea of integrating with a google account
- Colour Schemes: wants cool tone blues, not yellow/brown/red
    - Similar to a google Calendar
- Good with the tech stack
- Need to figure out Docker
- Use this as inspo: https://getdex.com/
- Use SQLite for now and maybe switch to Postgres later
- Start w/ object Map
