## Notes

- Relationship rating quiz- present options (blocks) to help users answer questions
- Wants to use Facebook/ any other platform that does not require approval
- AI generated questions- keep the static questions for now
    - Want to maximize user answers so have two separate sets of questions (AI generated) and static. The user can pick their approach/ the questions they want to answer
- Marc is happy with the UI currently
- Gamify the website- encourage users to enter more contacts, streaks for interacting with contacts, etc
- Sync google calendar both ways
