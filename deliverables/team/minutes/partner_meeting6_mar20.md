Feedback from Marc on questions in agenda:

- Keep it as mock data until we can research/find something else to integrate in
- Gamify feed via streaks
- Add tags to events/tasks (sortable in log page)
    - Categorize those things, custom categories
    - Dynamic list of tags in the events/tasks model probably
- Makes log feature more actionable
    - Gamify log via mission bars (maybe, if doable)
    - Filter by event/task tags
    - Search bar
